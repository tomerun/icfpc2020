# ICFP Programming Contest 2020

team name : tomerun

* src/main.cr
    * ship AI
    * rotates around avoiding collision with the planet
    * it didn't attack by shoot nor denotate because I couldn't realize their command spec
* src/defs.cr, src/parser.cr, src/reducer.cr
    * galaxy evaluator and visualizer
    * just output the screen to an image file
    * I couldn't create a clickable UI
* src/modem.cr
    * converter between cons list <-> modulated binary form <-> Crystal Array


This problem was too hard for single person team without knowledges of functional programming languages.
I miserably spent first two days for implementing galaxy evaluator. That's why I could only create trivial AI.

Anyway I appreciate organizers' effort to administrate this challenging competition without any severe trouble.
